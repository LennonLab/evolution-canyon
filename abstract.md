**Background/Question/Methods**

Communities are assembled through a combination of dispersal and local environmental conditions. 
Environmental factors can influence assembly via selecting for taxa adapted to the local conditions. 
However, some long-lived taxa may persist in the community if they are able overcome unfavorable environmental conditions by entering dormancy. 
We tested the relative influences of species sorting and dormancy on soil bacterial communities at Evolution Canyon, Israel. 
Evolution Canyon represents a natural experiment and model system for studying biodiversity, adaptation, and speciation given its two distinct slopes â€“ a xeric, south facing slope and a mesic, north facing slope. 
Given the proximity of the two slopes and the high level of dispersal by microorganisms, this site provides an excellent opportunity to test the importance of local conditions and dormancy on the assembly of microbial communities. 
We tested the importance of species sorting and dormancy using a spatial survey of soil bacterial communities. 
First, we measured species sorting as the difference in soil bacterial community between the two slopes via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Second, we used a comparison of the total and active portions of the microbial community to infer the role of dormancy on each slope (16S rRNA gene and transcript, respectively).

**Results/Conclusions**

Based on microclimate and soil characteristics the two slopes of Evolution Canyon are distinct despite being separated by ~150 meters. 
We found significant differences in community structure between the two slopes of Evolution Canyon (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.43). 
In addition, there was strong evidence for dormancy based on segregation of the total and active portions of the bacterial community (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.22). 
Our results suggest that dormancy is an important life-history trait used to overcome local environmental stresses such as high UV radiation, desiccation, and high temperatures. 
In addition, given the close proximity of the slopes and the high level of dispersal by microbes, our results suggest that local conditions (species sorting) influence community assembly for soil bacteria regardless of dispersal (mass effects). 
Together, these results support the idea that local environmental conditions (specifically stressors) influence species sorting and dormancy. 
Furthermore, species sorting and dormancy are important components of community assembly that together have the potential to mask dispersal even at high rates.
